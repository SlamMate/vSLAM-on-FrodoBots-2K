# vSLAM-on-FrodoBots-2K
 FrodoBots-2K is a very cool dataset, We'll put some details on how to use it for visual SLAM.

# 2. Calibration
According to my experiment, the approximate Calibration param is as the file Robot_Zero.yaml. We buy the robot, but it will take some time to deliver.
# 2. Merge video frames
The video frames in FrodoBots-2K are discrete, you need to merge them into a longer video.
